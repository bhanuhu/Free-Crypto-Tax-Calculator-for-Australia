    ques:"What's the difference between long-term and short-term capital gains?",
    ans:"The distinction between long-term and short-term capital gains lies in the duration of ownership. When you own an asset, such as cryptocurrency, for more than 12 months, any gains from its sale are categorised as long-term. These long-term gains often receive a 50% discount on the capital gains tax (CGT). In contrast, if you hold the asset for 12 months or less, the gains are considered short-term, and they are taxed at your regular income tax rate."

    ques:"Do I have to pay tax on crypto-to-crypto transactions?",
